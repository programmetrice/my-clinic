<p>(*) Bassett Healthcare Network and the employed Bassett Healthcare Network Physician Group participate in all products under Excellus, Empire Plan for NYS Employees (NYSHIP) and RMSCO. Primarily due to the NYS Health Benefit Exchange, each of the other payers listed may have plans in which Bassett Healthcare Network and the Bassett Healthcare Network Physician Group do not participate. If you are enrolled in one of these other plans, please be sure to verify benefits directly with your chosen health plan. The health plan contact information can be found on the back of your insurance identification card.</p>

        <i class="far fa-handshake"></i>

        <p>My Clinic works with hundreds of insurance companies and is an in-network provider for millions of people. In most cases, My Clinic doesn't require a physician referral. Some insurers require referrals, or may have additional requirements for certain medical care. All appointments are prioritized on the basis of medical need, and the team members who will care for you or your family have the expertise and skills to provide the best care possible.</p>
